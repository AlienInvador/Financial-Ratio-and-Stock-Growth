Financial Ratio and Stock Growth
Author: Tej Patel
ðŸ§  Research Question
Are companies with lower Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios more likely to have higher stock price growth?

This project investigates whether a company's valuationâ€”measured by its P/E ratioâ€”can predict its future stock performance. Specifically, it examines whether S&P 500 companies with lower P/E ratios in 2020 experienced greater stock price growth over the next five years.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
The goal is to evaluate the relationship between the P/E ratio and 5-year stock returns (2020â€“2025) using financial data from Kaggle and stock price data from Yahoo Finance. The results will help assess whether "value" stocks (with low P/E) outperform others over the long term.
