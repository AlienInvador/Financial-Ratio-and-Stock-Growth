## Research Question and Goal

<br>

Research Question: Are companies with lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios more likely to have higher stock price growth?

<br>

Goal: Using the Price-to-Earnings Ratio from 2020 data from Kaggle, we can compare the five-year return value of stocks from 2020 up to 2025 to see if the lower P/E ratio did cause a higher return value of stocks over the past five years.

Dependent Variable: Five-Year Return value from Stocks

## Hypothesis

<br>

Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no relationship between the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and 5-year stock return. (P/E ratio does not predict future stock growth.)

<br>

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a negative relationship between the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and 5-year stock return. (Lower P/E ratios are associated with higher future stock growth.)

<br>

In hypothesis testing, to reject the null hypothesis, the p-value must be less than your significance level (α). (α = 0.05)

## Result and Conclusion:

Since the pearson r value is 0.079 and the p-value is bigger than 0.05, no conclusion can be made about the relationship between P/E and five-year return value from stocks.This result has important implications for investors, financial planners, and market analysts. This disproves the idea that low Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio automatically leads to long-term stock appreciation.Ultimately, it reminds us that when it comes to investing, no single variable is a guarantee for success and diversification are still essential.
